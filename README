Basic *nix build instructions:
	./autogen.sh	# only needed if building from git repo
	./nomacro.pl	# only needed if building on Mac OS X
	./configure CFLAGS="-O3"
	make

Basic Windows build instructions, using MinGW:
	Install MinGW and the MSYS Developer Tool Kit (http://www.mingw.org/)
		* Make sure you have mstcpip.h in MinGW\include
	Install libcurl devel (http://curl.haxx.se/download.html)
		* Make sure you have libcurl.m4 in MinGW\share\aclocal
		* Make sure you have curl-config in MinGW\bin
	In the MSYS shell, run:
		./autogen.sh	# only needed if building from git repo
		LIBCURL="-lcurldll" ./configure CFLAGS="-O3"
		make

Usage instructions:  Run "minerd --help" to see options.

Connecting through a proxy:  Use the --proxy option.
To use a SOCKS proxy, add a socks4:// or socks5:// prefix to the proxy string.
If no protocol is specified, the proxy is assumed to be a HTTP proxy.
When the --proxy option is not used, the program honors the http_proxy
environment variable.  In this case, however, libcurl 7.21.7 or newer is
needed to handle protocol prefixes.

Also many issues and FAQs are covered in the forum thread
dedicated to this program,
